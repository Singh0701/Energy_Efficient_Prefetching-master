How to use P-CACTI?
====================

-> define the cache model using the files in ./xmls directory.
-> for CMOS, run the "cacti" binary: "./cacti -infile xmls/cache_config_cmos.xml -outfile pcacti_detailed_report.txt"
-> for FinFET, run the "cacti" binary: "./cacti -infile xmls/cache_config_finfet.xml -outfile pcacti_detailed_report.txt"

Detailed simulation report will be written in "./pcacti_detailed_report.txt". Also, there will be a simulation summary written in "./pcacti_report.txt".

====================

Neelu: 

NOTE: Please run the following command in case of errors related to missing bits/c++congif.h file: 

sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib 

-> Adding script to run pcacti with different configs and extract relevant stats as results. 

Run the following command, which will generate result files for caches, tlbs, and prefetcher structures in the "results" directory under separate directories: 

python3 scripts/get_energy_for_all.py 

Eg. the directory "results/L1D_32KB_8w" contains the extracted stats as well as xml config file for 32 KB L1D cache with 8 ways.
